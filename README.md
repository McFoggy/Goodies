Render maps directrly in GitHub. Simply create a file with JSON in and that's it! See this cool [Geo JSON example](./map.geojson) shamelesly stolen from [Ben Balter's repo](https://github.com/benbalter/dc-wifi-social). More on this topic over there : 
- [Mapping GeoJSON files on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github/) from the original documentation,
- [How to convert Shapefiles to GeoJSON maps for use on GitHub (and why you should)](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/) from Ben Balter to figure out how to create your own geojson files from shapefiles. 

Jupyter notebooks mix text, data and rendering. Create them on [Jupyter.org](https://try.jupyter.org/) and store the result on GitHub.[See Jupyter example](./jupyter.ipynb)
